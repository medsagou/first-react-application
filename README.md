<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This React application is designed to handle the shopping cart for an online store. It allows users to increment or delete the quantity of an item in their cart, and reset the cart entirely.
Here's why:

In addition, there is a reset button that allows the user to clear their entire cart with a single click. This feature can come in handy if the user changes their mind about their purchases or wants to start over.

The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses state to keep track of the items in the cart and their quantities, and it updates the display in real-time as the user interacts with the cart.

Overall, this React application provides a convenient and user-friendly way for shoppers to manage their purchases and keep track of their spending.

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
